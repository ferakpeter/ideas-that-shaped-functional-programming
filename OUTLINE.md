# Outline Ideas that shaped Functional Programming

This is also referred to as Atwood's law, while it is true it all applications that can execute in Javascript will run in Javascript, it is not true anymore that applications are written in Javascript.

With this talk I will attempt to try to answer the question why Functional Programming languages are now coming into the mainstream now. And what we can learn from it's beginnings to leverage the tools we're given.

But let's branch into music for a second.

## Music
Music is not really taught in such a setting. While parents nowadays put their kids into as many courses as they can, for sports, music, arts, anything. This was not the case for most people only 100 years back. Most people could not afford tutors. And yet stories were handed down from generation to generation, music that was played in the cotton fields of the United States spread throughout the world eventually.

And this is no coincidance. This has to do a lot with how music and arts evolves. It is best learned by examples, or actually it is learned by the act of performing it. People who listen and observe, remember, try and modify it.

That looks familiar, right? When we make a new program we almost always start from an existing solution, study it, and then modify it step by step.

Music and programming are not the same subject-matter. But I would argue that there are some parallels, especially when it comes to how we teach and learn it. And both Music and programming are very fast changing fields. Someone is doing something new all the time, but both are based on a set of rules that never change. In music the scales and rythmic rules are the same for all kinds of music. In programming our rules were discovered by Mathematicians already before there machines.
